<p2> Abstract </p2>

<p>
In this project, a sporting club energy demand has been analyzed. Following the analysis and an energy modelling, different energy efficiency solutions have been proposed. 
These include: the substitution of lights with LED lighting, the installation of PV and solar collectors and the installation of a micro-cogenerator.
Results show how all the solutions have a positive return, with LED lighting and the micro-cogenerator most suitable for the specific application.

<p3> Development </p3>

<p> The project has been carried for a local sporting club in Florence, in collaboration with colleagues Dr. Lorenzo Milardi and Dr. Claudio Galli. 
A sporting center is a perfect example for an energy efficiency project, including both electric and thermal loads. </p>

<p> Firstly, a site inspection has been performed, to identify the main energy loads and collect information about power and operations time. 
The sporting club main elements were the tennis courts (of which some coverable), the restaurant and the pool. </p>

<p> Then, energy consumptions have been collected, analyzing the bills for the previous two years.
Thanks to the inventory, it has been possible to modelling every electricity load, in order to have a disaggregated model of the demand. 
The image shows how total consumption of the model are consistent with the collected demand.
For the thermal loads this has not been necessary because energy bills were already disaggregated.</p>

<p> The first energy efficiency proposal has been to switch the courts illumination to LED lighting, maintaing the same illuminance (lux). This is one of the most common and profitable intervention. 
 The intervention would require an investment of 125k€ that would reach break even in only 3.26 years. 
 At the end of a 10 years live span the Return of Investment (ROI) would be of 141% with a Internal Return Rate (IRR) of 30%. </p>
 
<p> Regarding the energy production, two possibilities of investment have been proposed. The first based on solar panels and the second on a cogeneration micro-turbine.

<p> To cover both the electric and thermal loads, the proposal includes PV panels and solar collectors. However, the latter would be able to cover only the load for Domestic Hot Water (DHW).
The design of both the solutions has been carried with the software <a href="https://www.edilizianamirial.it/fotovoltaico/" target="_blank">Namirial Termo Energia</a>.
The PV panels would place in the parking lot of the sporting club, where plenty of space is available. 
Due to favorable energy tariffs and the lack of independence need, no energy storage has been included, meaning the necessity a bi-directional electricity flow.
The intervention would require an investment of 180k€ that would reach break even in around 11 years.
At the end of a 20 years live span the Return of Investment (ROI) would be of 60% with a Internal Return Rate (IRR) of 9%. 
The solar collectors would place on the rooftop of the club buildings. Being the DHW a minor demand, the CAPEX of this solution is 28.5K€, but still with a payback time of around 12 years (ROI and IRR respectively 44% and 7.82%). </p>


<p> Finally, an alternative proposal of investment has been a cogeneration micro-turbine, as suitable with the double demand of the sporting club, and with a possible convinience derived by the a better gas tariff than the electric one.
Energy balances have been performed through <span class="strong2"> Excel </span>.
The design criteria has been to cover the electricity demand of the last intensive months. The derived thermal energy would require to be wasted in case of excess, or to be paired by the standard boiler if not sufficient to cover the load. 
A commercial available micro-cogenerator has been chosen following the energy consideration. 
The design seems profitable, with an investment of 150k€ that would reach the break even point in 5.58 years.
At the end of a 10 years live span the Return of Investment (ROI) would be of around 88% with a Internal Return Rate (IRR) of 17%.</p>
